In the backend I am creating, editing updating and deleting mazes.

  * The mazes are saved as array of 6400 1s or 0s.
  * I am finding and deleting them with their IDS, which I am sending as part of the params
  * Most of the work is being done on the front end.
  * I am editing their successes and attempts by incrementing them based on if they passed or failed the maze.
